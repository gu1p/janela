A simple Python package for managing and manipulating application windows on **GUI** environments. **janela** provides an easy-to-use interface for moving, resizing, maximizing, minimizing, and arranging windows across multiple monitors.

**Note:** Currently, Janela supports **Linux** platforms. Support for **Windows** and **macOS** is in progress and will be available in future releases.

## Features

- **Move windows between monitors**: Easily transfer windows from one monitor to another.
- **Resize windows**: Adjust the size of windows programmatically.
- **Maximize and minimize windows**: Control window states effortlessly.
- **Focus on windows**: Bring specific windows to the foreground.
- **Close windows**: Programmatically close application windows.
- **Arrange windows in mosaic patterns**: Organize your windows in a mosaic layout across your monitors.

## Installation

### Linux

First, ensure that you have the required system dependencies installed.

#### Install `xdotool` and `wmctrl`

On **Debian/Ubuntu-based systems**:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xdotool wmctrl
```

#### Install Janela

You can install Janela from PyPI:

```bash
pip install janela
```

### Windows (Coming Soon)

Support for **Windows** platforms is currently under development. Stay tuned for upcoming releases that will include Windows support.

### macOS (Coming Soon)

Support for **macOS** platforms is in progress. We are working on bringing Janela's capabilities to macOS users in future updates.

## Requirements

- **Linux operating system**
- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- System packages (Linux only):
  - [`xdotool`](https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/)
  - [`wmctrl`](http://tomas.styblo.name/wmctrl/)
- Python packages:
  - [`python-xlib`](https://pypi.org/project/python-xlib/)

## Usage

**Note:** The following usage examples are applicable to **Linux** platforms. Support for Windows and macOS is coming soon.

### Basic Example

Arrange all windows in a mosaic pattern across all monitors:

```python
from janela import Janela, playground

# Initialize the window manager
ja = Janela()

# Arrange windows in a mosaic pattern
playground.mosaic(ja)
```

### Moving a Window to Another Monitor

```python
from janela import Janela

# Initialize the window manager
ja = Janela()

# Get a window by name
window = ja.get_window_by_name("Mozilla Firefox")

# Get the target monitor (e.g., monitor with ID 1)
target_monitor = ja.get_monitor_by_id(1)

# Move the window to the target monitor
if window and target_monitor:
  window.move_to_monitor(target_monitor)
```

### Resizing and Moving Windows

```python
from janela import Janela

ja = Janela()

# Get the active window
window = ja.get_active_window()

if window:
  # Move the window to position (100, 100)
  window.set_position(100, 100)

  # Resize the window to width 800 and height 600
  window.resize(800, 600)
```

### Maximizing and Minimizing Windows

```python
from janela import Janela

ja = Janela()

# Get a window by name
window = ja.get_window_by_name("Terminal")

if window:
  # Maximize the window
  window.maximize()

  # Check if the window is maximized
  if window.is_maximized():
    print(f"Window '{window.name}' is maximized.")

  # Minimize the window
  window.minimize()
```

### Focusing and Closing Windows

```python
from janela import Janela

ja = Janela()

# Get a window by name
window = ja.get_window_by_name("Text Editor")

if window:
  # Focus the window
  window.focus()

  # Close the window
  window.close()
```

## API Reference

### WindowManager

The `WindowManager` class is the main interface to manage windows and monitors.

**Methods:**

- `list_windows()`: List all open windows.
- `list_monitors()`: List all available monitors.
- `get_active_window()`: Get the currently active window.
- `get_window_by_name(name)`: Get a window by its name.
- `get_monitor_by_id(monitor_id)`: Get a monitor by its ID.

### Window

Represents a window in the system.

**Attributes:**

- `id`: The window ID.
- `name`: The window name.
- `x`, `y`: The position of the window.
- `width`, `height`: The dimensions of the window.
- `is_active`: Whether the window is currently active.

**Methods:**

- `set_position(x, y)`: Move the window to the specified position.
- `move(x, y)`: Move the window by the specified offset.
- `resize(width, height)`: Resize the window.
- `minimize()`: Minimize the window.
- `maximize()`: Maximize the window.
- `move_to_monitor(monitor)`: Move the window to the specified monitor.
- `is_maximized()`: Check if the window is maximized.
- `unmaximize()`: Unmaximize the window.
- `focus()`: Bring the window to the foreground.
- `close()`: Close the window.

### Monitor

Represents a monitor connected to the system.

**Attributes:**

- `id`: The monitor ID.
- `name`: The monitor name.
- `x`, `y`: The position of the monitor.
- `width`, `height`: The dimensions of the monitor.

**Methods:**

- `list_windows()`: List all windows on this monitor.
- `contains(x, y)`: Check if a point is within this monitor.
- `is_vertical()`: Check if the monitor is vertically oriented.
- `is_horizontal()`: Check if the monitor is horizontally oriented.
- `aspect_ratio()`: Get the aspect ratio of the monitor.

## Tested Platforms

The following table lists the operating systems and distributions where **Janela** has been tested. This helps track where the library works and where it might encounter issues.

| Operating System | Distribution | Version(s)              | Status           |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Linux**        | Ubuntu (KDE) | 20.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS    | âœ… Works          |
| **Windows**      | -            | -                       | ðŸš§ In Progress    |
| **macOS**        | -            | -                       | ðŸš§ In Progress    |

*Note: As the library is designed specifically for Linux systems at the moment, Windows and macOS support is currently under development. We are actively working on bringing Janela's capabilities to these platforms in future releases.*
